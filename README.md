# LL Cube Algorithm Addon

This addon is made for cubers (people with the hobby of quickly solving the Rubik's Cube) who wish to learn LL algorithms with Anki.
It creates a new Note Type, which allows the user to swiftly write or paste LL algorithms that the cuber wants to memorise without having to generate or import images. Other features include:
- randomly rotating the cube before having it reverse the algorithm: have a different F color each time;
- setup colour neutrality: define which colours you want to see as U face colour;
- generate extra cards for different AUF: define from which angles you want to train recognising the cases (U, U', U2);
- learn different algorithms depending on the AUF;
- scramble the cube before applying the reverse of the algorithm;
- have the UB stickers hidden, as they aren't visible.
